# London's safest and most dangerous boroughs - an analysis

An analysis of London crime data published by the MET and a rank of the safest boroughs in London(2018)

# Files 
* Rmd file with report and analysis
* Csv file used to carry out analysis. Contains MPS Borough Level Crime which was sourced from the London Datastore website. The data covers the number of recorded offences in the 32 MPD boroughs at the offence category and offence type levels for each month over the years 2008-2018. This dataset has 1,056 observations and 135 variables. These variables are a mix of categorical and numeric types. Additionally, the data was provided by the London Metropolitan Police Service and therefore does not cover offences under the City of London Police jurisdiction - recorded offences in the City of London
